 * the container of any information that is larger than a status code. It gets 
 * passed to the library, by handing over a pointer to the already allocated 
 * piece as well as the number of chunks that are contiguously allocated after 
 * the pointer. The library is supposed to handle chunks in a manner, that not 
 * all chunks have to be allocated contiguously, but multiple chunks can only 
 * be given to the library at once, if they are allocated contiguously. 
 *
 * Each UaD-Library is allowed to define their chunk size. Thus a initialization protocol is needed. The consumer is responsible 
 * for allocating and deallocating these chunks. These chunks are passed to the 
 * library via the uadi_push_chunks(...) function.
